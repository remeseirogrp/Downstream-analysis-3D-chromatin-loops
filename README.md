# Downstream-analysis-3D-chromatin-loops
Additional analysis to understand chromatin loop impact in cells

A short tutorial on R to integrate loops from HiC/ HiChIP for further downstream analysis.

## Example analysis
Use the requiredPackages.R to install the packages we shall use in the analysis. The entire tutorial with output is depicted in an HTML file called loop-additional-analysis.html in the PALS2024 folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/remeseirogrp/Downstream-analysis-3D-chromatin-loops.git

```
## Toy Data
Clone or download Downstream-analysis-3D-chromatin-loops to download the tutorial with installation requirements.

## The additional_files folder
This folder has the raw script and the raw data that was used to build the tutorial. Example output for UPSET plot, loop length and other output files are located in this folder.
